 asur_government_desc:0 "The High Elves rely on a mild form of autocracy, centered on cities rather than fortresses. While the elven Princes are respected and obeyed and pass down their titles by blood, they are required to treat properly all their highborn subjects. Elven rulers cannot imprison any of their subjects without a proper reason and cannot revoke titles from their elven vassals, except in some extreme circumstances. In return, they have absolutely no obligations in regards of their inferior non-elven subjects."

 druchii_government_desc:0 "The Druchii are proud and stubborn as their insular cousins, but they are also vicious raiders and slavers renown for their cruelty. Druchii society is built upon mistrust and backstabbing, the Dark Elves are slow to trust and ready to mercilessly enslave humans and other lesser races without the least concern for their well-being."

 chivalric_feudal_government_desc:0 "[grail|E] worship generally demands much more of how its followers organize their realms than most other faiths. Rulers are expected to follow the code of chivalry in their deeds, creating a system where every action is suffused with religious fervor. The most important differences are that subinfeudation - vassals doling their lands out to new vassals - is expected and that all lords must also have a Castellan, a diarch who supervises the lord's holdings while they are on acts of errantry."

 pirate_government_desc:0 "Pirate fleets are alliances of multiple pirate crews banded together under a common flag and a single leader they have chosen to follow for strength of numbers, loyalty, or just a demonstrated ability of their elected leader to gather booty. The collection of crews within the fleet are of diverse nature, being seabound bandits, professional privateers working for the benefit of another, merchants deciding to pay in steel and shot instead of gold and silver, or even the military of a realm itself engaged in plundering their political rivals. The individual crews within the fleet are highly autonomous and come to the aid of their leader when called upon to put together a mightly piratical armada under the black flag."
