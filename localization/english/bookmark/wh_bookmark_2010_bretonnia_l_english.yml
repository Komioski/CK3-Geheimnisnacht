 bm_2010_bretonnia_desc:0 "In the year 981(2010 IC) of the Warhammer world, the kingdom of Bretonnia finds itself enveloped in a tense and precarious political situation. Three years prior, in 978(2007 IC), the kingdom faced a dire threat when a Chaos horde invaded, laying siege to the city of Couronne. In this dark hour, King Louis the Brave fell in defense of his realm, marking a turning point in Bretonnian history. Amidst this chaos, an unlikely hero emerged. A peasant shepherdess Repanse from the Lyonesse, who led the troops to a miraculous victory against the Chaos army. In recognition of her valor and leadership, she was elevated to nobility by the newly crowned King Louis the Young, receiving the dukedom of Lyonesse as a reward for her bravery.\n However, this unprecedented rise of a commoner to the ranks of nobility sparked unrest within the kingdom. The southern duchies, in particular, revolted against this break in tradition, viewing the elevation of a peasant to such high status as a challenge to the established order and a threat to their privileges.\n The kingdom's internal strife was further complicated by the awakening of the ancient vampire, the Red Duke, who emerged from his slumber to lay claim to the lands of Aquitaine. This confluence of internal rebellion and supernatural threat has left Bretonnia in a state of turmoil, with its future uncertain as it navigates the complex dynamics of honor, tradition, and survival in a world teeming with dark magic and menace."

His early reign saw controversy when he knighted Repanse, a shepherdess-hero, leading to revolt among southern duchies. Elevated to a Grail Knight by the Lady of the Lake's blessing, Luis faced the dual challenge of quelling unrest and countering threats like the Red Duke. Despite the heavy expectations on his young shoulders, Luis aimed to unify Bretonnia, embodying the virtues of his kingdom and striving to navigate through its internal and external trials with a blend of youthful ambition and divine favor."

Donning armor from a fallen knight and wielding a sacred sword, she rallied the knights of Lyonesse with a makeshift Fleur de Lys banner. Her audacity led to a miraculous victory over Chaos Lord Kharan the Blighted, saving Couronne. Recognized for her bravery, King Louis the Young knighted her and granted her the Dukedom of Lyonesse, marking her rise from obscurity to nobility as a symbol of faith and valor."

Known by many monikers – the 'Scourge of Aquitaine', the 'Northern Sword', the 'Blood-Kissed Duke', and El Syf ash-Shml to the Arabyans – his name evokes fear across the lands of Bretonnia and beyond."

 bookmark_bretonnia_lambert_desc:0 "At just 9 years old, Lambert became embroiled in Bretonnian politics as one of six dukes who opposed King Luis the Young. Their rebellion was sparked by the king’s decision to grant nobility to Repanse de Lyonesse, a commoner turned hero. Lambert's involvement highlights the rigid social hierarchies and the significant influence of noble birth in Bretonnia, where the ascent of a non-noble to the ranks of the aristocracy could stir unrest among the nobility.\n Lambert’s role in this revolt, despite his youth, underscores the deeply ingrained expectations placed upon noble heirs from an early age, suggesting the complex interplay of power, lineage, and tradition within the kingdom. His story illustrates the tension between Bretonnia's cherished ideals and the evolving dynamics of its society, marking him as a notable figure in the realm's storied history of loyalty, honor, and resistance."
