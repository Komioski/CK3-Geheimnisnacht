 bm_2010_age_of_four_emperors_desc:0 "The turn of the millennium was a time of great change and upheaval in what was left of the Empire. It was heralded in an ominous fashion when the city of Mordheim was destroyed by a warpstone meteor at the stroke of midnight. For over six centuries the Empire had been in a state of civil war, with each of claimants to the Imperial throne making war upon any who would deny their right to rule. This infighting would prove to have disastrous consequences, as heresy and corruption of all kinds festered and grew in the absence of any unified strength."

 bookmark_elected_emperor_magritta_desc:0 "During what was later known as the Time of Three Emperors, the line of elected Emperors continued to hold against the Emperors of Talabecland and the Wolf Emperors of Middenland. This tenuous authority ended in 1979 IC when the infant Grand Baroness Magritta van der Maacht of Westerland was elected with only the support of Elector Counts of Wissenland, Stirland, and Averland. The Grand Theogonist, seeing this for the farce that was, declared the office of Emperor vacant. Magritta naturally disputes this and is willing to enforce her claim through force of arms if need be. The fractured states in the Empire could provide the opportunity for 'Empress' Magritta to make this dream become a reality, or it could be her destruction."

 bookmark_wolf_emperor_mannfred_desc:0 "Almost two centuries after the civil war over the Imperial throne began, the matter was still not settled. The situation worsened noticeably when the Ulrican Grand Duke Heinrich of Middenland lost the Imperial Election to the Sigmarite Grand Count of Wissenland. Believing himself robbed of his birthright he stormed off in a rage back to Middenheim. There, with the support of the Ar-Ulric, the Grand Duke issued a proclamation declaring himself Emperor, issuing coins and edicts to that effect, and declaring the Sigmarite faith false and heretical. This Ulrican line of so-called 'Wolf' Emperors has continued to this day with Mannfred Todbringer, but like his ancestors it may well be that his reach exceeds his grasp."

 bookmark_ottilian_emperor_ottilia_desc:0 "Following the death of the legendary Mandred 'Skavenslayer', the office of Emperor became a ceremonial title, traded among the Elector Counts for favours. This state of affairs ended in 1359 IC when the the Grand Count of Stirland was elected to serve as Emperor, much to the chagrin of Grand Duchess Ottilia of Talabecland. Supported by the cult of Taal and Rhya, Ottilia decided to press her own claim to the throne. Despite winning a decisive victory in the Battle of the Talabec in 1360 IC, Ottilia was ultimately unable take the throne for herself. Still, Talabeland's independence and Ottilia's claim to the throne have been preserved to this day. The current (self styled) Empress Ottilia, like her ancestor of the same name, seeks to unite the Empire under her rule. It remains to be seen if ancient Talabecland can survive the coming wars."

 bookmark_theogonist_emperor_siegfried_desc:0 "In the aftermath of the Grand Theogonist's dissolution of the Empire in 1980 IC, nobles across the Empire began to picture themselves sitting the Imperial throne. Greatest among these was Grand Prince Siegfried von Holzkrug of Reikland. Reikland has always considered itself the most important place in the Empire, as it was location where the the Unberogen tribe of Sigmar's blood had settled. Altdorf's strategic location on the Reik and the near-unconditional support of the Cult of Sigmar has always helped reinforce this claim, much to the chagrin of other Electors. Known elsewhere as the Reikland Pretender, Siegfried seeks the Imperial throne for himself and already has the support of Wissenland. Only time will tell if Siegfried's abilities are equal to his ambitions."

 bookmark_vampire_lord_vlad_desc:0 "Independent from Stirland since the Night of the Restless Dead in 1681, Sylvania had long been ruled by the von Drak dynasty. This all changed in 1797 when Count Otto 'the Mad', now on his death bed, married his daughter Isabella to the mysterious Vlad von Carstein to keep his brother Leopold from the throne. Leopold von Drak saw his inheritance slipping away and protested the union, only to be hurled from the castle's window by Vlad. This was later known as the First Defenestration of Drakenhof. Vlad and Isabella ruled for many years in a fair, but often brutal fashion (as can be seen in the Second through Thirteenth Defenestrations of Drakenhof). As Sylvania was backwater in the Empire, no one questioned how each new Count of Sylvania looked so similar to the one before him. However, Sylvania will not stay a backwater for much longer."
