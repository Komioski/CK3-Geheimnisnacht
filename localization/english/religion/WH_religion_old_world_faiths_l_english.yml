 ahaltan_adj:0 "Ahaltan"
 ahaltan_desc:0 "Ahalt was the primary god of the Menogoths and represents their god of fertility and the hunt. Worshippers of Ahalt embrace an endless cycle of life and death, and subsequently revel in it - living things are to be removed from this world (through hunting), and that which they leave behind is to be used to create more living things (through childbirth). Many outsiders mistake his epithet of "the drinker" to mean that he is a drunkard; In reality, Ahalt drinks part of the blood of every death that happens during a hunt. This blood, it is said, empowers him to bestow his followers (and the land they live in) bountiful harvests and plentiful game, such that they may continue to feed him and themselves. Darker rumors abound of human sacrifice and ritual bloodletting when hunts prove insufficient to slake Ahalt's thirst, however. This, combined with conflicts over the domain of the natural world, has led to the Cult of Ahalt having tempestuous relations with the cult of [taal|E] and [rhya|E]."

 halfling_gods_desc:0 "The halflings, owing to the strangeness of the rest of their society, worship a similarly strange set of gods. They revere [sigmar|E] as an all-powerful protector deity, the product of their assimilation into Imperial society, but largely worship a mix of local gods and other gods from elsewhere in the Empire. Most of their effort in located in the worship of [esmeralda|E], goddess of hearth and home, [phineas|E], god of tobacco, [josias|E], god of farming, and [hyacinth|E], goddess of fertility. Halfling worship is not as formalized as other Imperial gods, and their gods are closer to individuals with godly powers than being true gods. [josias_long|E] does not hold power over agriculture, for example, but instead always knows the weather and can grant a halfling farmer an omen about their crops. This approach has given the halflings a more friendly pantheon than their Imperial neighbors, allowing them to be as casual and care-free with their gods as they are with the rest of their lives - after all, asking for a favor is much different from requesting a boon!

Worshippers of Handrich are concerned with one thing and one thing alone in the course of their worship - the accumulation of money. Learning trades and developing charisma are smiled upon as well, but only because of the way in which they encourage more business. Of course, accumulating wealth does not mean hoarding it. Worshippers are expected to spend money just as generously as they make it, for the commerce this creates pleases the merchant god. Such commerce does not have to be honest, for lying is just another means to an end, provided that one follows the core maxim of Handrich worship: nothing cannot be given for something. When one of his followers dies, Handrich is said to tally up the money they earned and spent over the course of their life. If both are sufficiently high, then the deceased merchant will be given an estate of his own in the afterlife. Those most likely to receive this treatment are the entrepreneurs of the Old World, as Handrich is happy when one of his followers has the acumen required to organize a business."

The history of the cult dates back to the ancient Cherusen, whose affinity for the forest naturally led to a reverence for those who dwelled within it. The specificity of his domain has led to many comparisons between him and [ulric|E], typically placing Lupos as a subordinate aspect of [ulric|E] who represents only his love for wolves. Believers in the Cult of Lupos hold him as a wholly independent god, though in the process he is often held up as the more broad god of predators. To worship such a god is to ensure that nature takes its course; killing and eating another life is the highest form of devotion one can perform."

He holds absolute power over his domain - the oceans and everything they touch - and all that happens on and in the water is deliberately caused by his will. His temperament is mirrored in the ocean: tempestuous and inconsistent, violent at times, playful at others, and on occasion even kind and gracious. [manann|E] is above all a vain, jealous god, and so many rites and rituals have been created to give him the attention he seeks. This has led to his cult developing a number of practical seafaring skills, such as navigation, cartography, and quick thinking. Captains will often hire members of his cult to help them steer clear of troubled waters or to make sure they stay on course. This often has a double benefit, for this recognition of his priests only serves to sate [manann|E]'s hunger for attention. It is said that the skill the god prizes most is observation, and that he especially smiles on those who take care to avoid hazards at sea."

 #Cult of Sheirrich

 sheirrichan_adj:0 "Sheirrichan"
 sheirrichan_desc:0 "Sheirrich, also known as #bold Sheirrich the Wind Lord#!, was the patron god of the Brigundian tribe. He holds power over the winds of the world, and it is said that the breeze is actually his breath given physical form. Alongside this, owing to his power over the wind, he is also the god of freedom. Sheirrich is thus usually depicted as lenient, but lecherous and flighty. His patience is intense, but when sufficiently provoked he is able to muster his strength to perform great and terrible acts. When the Brigundians first moved into what would later become Averland they were beset and nearly destroyed by beastmen raids.  Sheirrich was so incensed that the beastmen would attack his people that he gathered his strength and, in one great exhale, scoured the land of beastmen, forest, and large sums of dirt besides, creating the rolling plains of Averland. Regardless of how true this tale is, those who worship him do so by recounting great deeds such as this and many others, screaming them into the wind such that the god knows that he is appreciated by his people. His control of the winds has led to frequent conflicts with the cult of [manann|E], who hold that the ocean breeze is a product of the will of their own god."

 sigmarite_desc:0 "Perhaps the most well-known religion in all the Old World, the Cult of [sigmar|E] represents those who primarily worship [sigmar_full_name|E], the legendary figure who created the Empire of Man. After uniting twelve separate tribes, they with their combined strength defeated a Waaagh that threatened to overrun the entire northern half of the continent. After this, [sigmar|E] united them into one singular empire, the Empire of Man. Through both peace and war, [sigmar|E] ruled The Empire for a period of fifty years, until one day he simply stood up, abdicated the throne, and then walked eastwards, never to be seen again.\n\nIn the year 73 IC, an individual named [johann_helstrum|E] claimed to have a vision of the legendary emperor being granted the crown of divinity by [ulric|E], for whom he championed in life. As [sigmar|E]'s deeds were already exceptional, many took this proclamation of divinity as fact and promptly began worshipping him. Worship of the god-emperor was so widespread that, within a decade, just about every town in the empire had at least a shrine in his name. He held dominion over the land of warfare (but specifically against non-humans), as well as being the protector god of the empire he had created.\n\nThose who worship [sigmar|E] do so by practicing an fanatical reverence for his empire, holding it as the greatest thing in all creation - a holy land that shows that humanity can do something more than squabble with one another until The End Times. To protect and strengthen the Empire is held as the greatest of all deeds for a Sigmarite. Particularly fervent believers are able to channel [sigmar|E]'s power through prayer to perform miracles, such as the exorcism of [Concept('daemon','daemons')|E]."

The pair expect that they are provided a sacrifice every month, either of grain or meat, and that any believer seeks out and destroys any aberration to the natural order, whether that be beastmen, mutations, or even the undead."

The worship of [dazh|E] takes different forms in both the north and south - in the south he is more akin to a god of hospitality, and in the north he is more revered as a savior on account of the sunlight he brings. While [dazh|E] does not expect much of his believers beyond simple worship, believers in the Cult of [dazh|E] are expected to tend to the fires everywhere they go, ensuring that they neither grow uncontrolled or are allowed to be extinguished."

The duty of this priest, beyond the obvious religious functions, is to oversee hunts and make sure that the animals are not wasted or killed dishonorably.

Though there are a wide variety of different descriptions for murder in the mortal world, Khaine only accepts those that are either done without cause or specifically done in his glory. This is what separates his human believers from the elves; while the elven Khaine is greedy for open bloodshed and a hundred other acts of malice, the human Khaine seeks only murder, and for his human followers to kill as much as possible. Should the proper rites be carried out (through the carving of runes onto living flesh), the souls of the dead are sent to feed Khaine rather than finding rest in the realm of [morr|E]. His cultists are required to feed him at least once a month, even if doing so results in their discovery. Those who can keep to his requirements and temporarily slake the god's thirst for murder are said to be totally protected in their post-death journey to the afterlife, and instead of passing on to [morr|E]'s realm, they are allowed to join Khaine and eternally sup on the blood and souls sent there by the still-living followers of the god. Due to the decentralized nature of their cult, this is the only tenet that is truly universal between his cults.

 myrmidian_desc:0 "[myrmidia|E] is, by far, the most widely worshipped god in the Old World. Universal in both Tilea and Estalia, and present to a lesser extent in other regions as well, the way in which the southern realms worship her is much different from how the Empire believes in her. In the south, she is prayed to at nearly every junction and her expertise consulted on much more than simple strategy. In the north, however, she is considered an "officer's god"; good for the higher-brow debates and plans that leaders make but not so good at keeping one's fellow men from being skewered. While both Tilean and Estalians hold different aspects of the goddess as primary, ultimately she is the same goddess and her followers still prize their honor and wit. All followers believe her to be the patron goddess of ancient Tylos and that she later walked among their descendants in order to learn more about the world, for example, even though there may be disputes on where her mortal incarnation was born. Worship of [myrmidia|E] revolves around adhering to a strict social code at all times, in addition to treating all enemy combatants honorably and fairly. The entire cult is fairly centralized, and outside of Tilea and Estalia most participants follow closely to the central teachings of L'Ultima Aquila (or La Última Águila) and consider them the paramount authority in all affairs religious."

 shallyan_grail_adj:0 "Shallyan"
 shallyan_grail_desc:0 "One of the most worshipped gods in Bretonnia is that of [shallya|E]. Some even worship her alongside [lady_of_the_lake|E], holding both as protector deities of the home. Others, however, have come to believe that the two are actually one and the same. [shallya|E]'s tears, as she weeps for Bretonnia, hold within them the true magic of the [thegrail|E]. When a knight sips from the [thegrail|E], they inherit a portion of her sorrow for the world - and it is this that grants them their power, driving them ever-onwards to cleanse the land of its doom. To its adherents, the supernatural powers the grail knights possess are less of a blessing, and more of an awakening - the depths of the Lady's sorrows are so deep that it drives men on to perform feats thought impossible. It is commonly believed that the two as they manifest are actually different halves of the same god, appearing in two different forms so as to cater to both the peasantry and the nobles at the same time."

 outlaw_pantheon_religion_desc:0 "The so-called "Outlaw Pantheon" is not named as such because they are worshipped by outlaws, even though they are, but because they themselves have been outlawed (for the most part) by nearly every proper state in the Old World. Most popular among their number are Gunndred, [ranald|E], and [stromfelsgod|E], the gods of banditry, thievery, and piracy respectively. Those who make a living under the patronage of these gods do not often shift between the different gods, for their crime of choice is usually a life-long profession. A common factor between all of the Outlaw Pantheon is the lack of a standard form of worship. To these gods, engaging in their chosen crime is worship, and the reasons why one does so do not matter outside of when they stop a believer from doing it again. While they have been subject to many attempts to push them out of memory, the Outlaw Pantheon's status as half-remembered folklore only ensures that those turning to banditry seek them out first."

#Cult of Gunndred  
 gunndredian:0 "Cult of Gunndred"
 gunndredian_adj:0 "Gunndredian"
 gunndredian_desc:0 "The patron god of highwaymen, bandits, and brigands, Gunndred is probably the most popular of the Outlaw Pantheon. In his domain is the act of coercion, in whatever form it may take; forcing another to do something against their will is, to Gunndred, an act of worship. It is for this reason that he prizes brutality and the ability to intimidate, for these are the things that can, among other things, drive a man to relinquish his valuables. Amusingly enough, he seems to have a soft spot in his heart for blackmailers for this same reason. Belief in the god is split down the middle between the common bandits that believe in him and the self-proclaimed "learned" highwaymen, mostly distinguished by the intricacy of their acts of worship. While in both cases their worship serves to strengthen their brutal god, it has also led to two popular interpretations of his existence - that of a brigand, or that of a brigand leader. For as long as there are bandits, their god shall continue to vindicate them in all their doings."

 ranaldian_adj:0 "Ranaldian"
 ranaldian_desc:0 "Of the Outlaw Gods, [ranald|E] is the only one that is technically not outlawed - in his capacity as a god of luck, freedom, and fortune, his cult is quite accepted. It is only when his worship crosses over into his less savory domain, that of trickery and thievery, that it becomes illegal. The Cult of [ranald|E] embodies all of these things, of course, but that is knowledge that is carefully kept as an open secret. It is understood that his priests mostly consist of rogues and pickpockets, but there is never any proof to link them to the deeds. Many others will believe in [ranald|E] for some aspect or another of his cult - most popular among the nobility is a reverence for luck, of course - without ever engaging in acts of theft. However, the desire to perform the darker acts associated with the god's name is one that afflicts all of his believers. Those that do indulge in such acts will learn that, ideally, nothing ever done for [ranald|E] is down to luck."

His is a curious cult, for it lacks the trappings, the pomp and majesty, even the structure of other cults. His priests are thieves, tricksters, and gamblers, rather than the educated effete elite so favoured by others. His temples are the gaming halls, the brothels, the taverns, and other dens of iniquity, not the gilt structures of gold and marble. Indeed, Ranald and his priests are unlike any others — a fact that is both distressing and delightful."
#Stromfels Faith Localization
 stromfels:0 "Cult of Stromfels"
 stromfels_adj:0 "Stromfellan"
 stromfels_desc:0 "Many think [stromfelsgod|E] to simply be the king of the threats lurking within the sea. His followers, however know [stromfelsgod|E] to be the true king of the oceans, the uncaring brutality of the water laid bare for all to see. His followers are nearly exclusively pirates, and the cult is likewise localized to the land that they inhabit. Followers of [stromfelsgod|E] do not apply morality to their actions at sea; they are chiefly predators, pursuing and consuming prey so that they may continue living for another day. Indeed, those who are able to help themselves are often rewarded by their god. While he is stingy with direct blessings, good winds and clear seas are said to follow the best of pirates wherever they go. The actual cult is decentralized in order to survive, and so there are at best only a handful of tenets shared between all of his followers, spread by the priests who accompany the predators of the sea."
