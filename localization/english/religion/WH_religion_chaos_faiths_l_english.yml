 game_concept_chaos_undivided_desc:0 "Chaos Undivided is the material from which all daemons and their gods originate. It is a singular primal force that, under the weight of its own entropy, cannot help but be split into countless smaller parts. Nearly none in the Warhammer World know the true nature of Chaos Undivided, for if they did it would surely drive them to despair and madness. For the most part, it is the thing that people refer to when they use \"Chaos\" as a whole."
 
 game_concept_chaos_undivided_religion:0 "Chaos Undivided"
 game_concept_chaos_undivided_religion_desc:0 "This name can be used not only to describe the cosmic force, but also a religion - meaning either the veneration of all Chaos Gods alltogether, at least the major ones, under one banner, rejection of the Gods, or otherwise worshipping Chaos as a whole, striving for unity between all Chaos. As becoming [daemon_prince|E] is impossible, this religion only consists of true believers, not desiring for boons, but genuine adherents. However, if one of them would conquer all the trials of the Gods, they would become an [everchosen|E], an immortal being of immeasureable, for mortal beings, power."

 game_concept_everchosen:0 "Everchosen"
 game_concept_everchosen_desc:0 "The Everchosen is a unique position in the hierarchy of Chaos - they are a follower of [chaos_undivided_religion|E] who has managed to attain the blessing of all four major Chaos Gods, and any number of other, smaller deities. Those with this role are granted immortality and the power to command the daemons of the gods in their stead. Using these, the Everchosen is charged with destroying the enemies of Chaos wherever they may lie, so that the gods may claim the world without opposition. Morkar the Uniter was the first such Everchosen, crowned in the year 50 IC and sent southwards to destroy [sigmar|E]."

 game_concept_khorne_desc:0 "Khorne is the Chaos God of battle. He feeds upon the passion that his followers hold as they go into battle, as they fight their enemies, and as they claim their hard-won victory. He is unconcerned to why his followers do battle in his name, so long as they continue to do so; of the 4 major Chaos Gods, he is the strongest - for everything fights, and everything relishes the triumph of the fight, even if they do not have the intelligence to reflect upon it. Khorne's rival is [slaanesh|E], for they fight over the limited passions of each person."

 game_concept_tzeentch:0 "Tzeentch"
 game_concept_tzeentch_desc:0 "Tzeentch is the Chaos God of change. Any act of change, whether it be big or small, sustains him - it requires only that something has ceased to be in favor of something else. The god spends his time plotting and scheming in order to engineer the change he needs to keep existing. While some of these plans would involve the defeat of his brethren, which he would very much like to do, it is ultimately a secondary goal for Tzeentch compared to ensuring nothing stays the same. His rival is [nurgle|E], who seeks a world where nothing changes."

 game_concept_slaanesh_desc:0 "Slaanesh is the Chaos God of passion. It is the act that Slaanesh prizes, whether it be the perfection of deed or the reactions to a new sensation or a myriad other things besides. This is not for the act itself, which is useless to the god save for the passion therein. Between the four gods, Slaanesh is the youngest, as it is only through higher thought that beings can experience such passion. His greatest enemy is [khorne|E], who seeks to banish the pleasures that Slaanesh needs to exist."

 game_concept_nurgle:0 "Nurgle"
 game_concept_nurgle_desc:0 "God of stagnation and decay, the being known as Nurgle first came into being as the first living beings sought to keep themselves alive. It is he that seeks stability, for the more things change, the more he is imperiled - only through cycles, unbreakable in nature, can Nurgle's very existence can be secured. He is for the most part content to let nature take its course, as it can be counted on to remain mostly the same, but he will always take up arms against [tzeentch|E]; stagnation can only exist by defeating change, after all. "

 game_concept_malal:0 "Malal"
 game_concept_malal_desc:0 "Malal is the Chaos God of strife. While any infighting works, he is in truth chiefly concerned with the conflicts between his brother gods - the endless, internecine wars between kin that prevent them from fully turning their attention onto the world of men are the very things that brought him into existence. Embodying these, he seeks always to destroy his kin, however possible, and fulfill his reason to exist. While decidedly more powerful than the other minor Chaos Gods, Malal is not considered one of the major gods because he would surely cease to exist if the other four did so as well. As such, he resides in an arrangement unique to himself."

 game_concept_hashut:0 "Hashut"
 game_concept_hashut_desc:0 "Hashut is a Chaos God of unknown origin that spends his time lording over the Chaos Dwarfs, shaping their society in favor of his own whims. To his subjects, he is known as the god of greed and tyranny (which are not bad things in Zharr-Naggrund), though unlike most Chaos Gods he is entirely detached from those things except for when they are done by the Chaos Dwarfs. He has been observed to be an aimlessly malicious god, seeking out sacrifices not because they benefit him but simply because he can force his patronized people to carry them out. The only other god he dedicates his attention towards is the [horned_rat|E], for which he harbors a deep and intense hatred for."

 game_concept_daemon_prince:0 "Daemon Prince"
 game_concept_daemon_prince_desc:0 "The greatest reward for any of the followers of the Chaos Gods is to be gifted their patronage, which will then irreversibly transform them into a Daemon Prince. More than simple boons or blessings, to become a Daemon Prince is to have served your target god so effectively, so consistently, that they grant you immortality through which you can continue to serve them for eternity. All Chaos Gods have the ability to create these beings, though they are different for each god. This is the ultimate reward for all who worship a Chaos God, though nearly none could ever hope to gain it."

 game_concept_horned_rat:0 "Horned Rat"
 game_concept_horned_rat_desc:0 "The Horned Rat is the patron and possible creator of the Skaven, whose priests are known to bear his likeness. While most Chaos Gods embody some quality or another, the Horned Rat is an exception - he is the god of the Skaven, and he will exist as long as his children do. When his will must be made manifest, he ensures that the right words are delivered to the right ears, such that his schemes can take primacy over those of the Skaven. While the ratmen are not terribly friendly to anything else, let alone themselves, the Horned Rat demands an unconditional hostility towards the Chaos Dwarfs and anything else that might serve [hashut|E]."

 hashut_religion_desc:0 "[hashut|E] is known as the Dark Father to the Chaos Dwarfs, though his existence is an enigma that confounds attempts at close study. As opposed to the major gods of [Concept('chaos_undivided','Chaos')|E], who do not necessarily care about the origin of their worshippers, [hashut|E] will only recognize his patronized Chaos Dwarfs. While [hashut|E] is commonly associated with greed, fire, and tyranny, he will only ever bestow his favor upon faithful Chaos Dwarfs; anyone else can expect to, at best, be ignored. He is a cruel and violent god, demanding constant sacrifices to him in only the most excruciating fashions possible (such as the infamous brazen bulls, where the victim is placed inside of a metal bull and a fire lit underneath) as well as regularly demanding that new forms of sacrifice be invented in order to satisfy him. In return for this, however, he grants his chosen people the secrets of their peculiar form of sorcery. His favored animal is the bull; those who earn his favor will often take on part of the form of a bull, such as the horns, and inherit their penchant for stubbornness. Interestingly, he seems to demand of his worshippers an unconventional hatred for the Skaven."

 hashut_desc:0 "[hashut|E] worship is far more homogenous than any of the other Chaos Gods, and as such the Chaos Dwarfs have the tenuous distinction of being the only ones to worship the "pure" form of their god. While there are a number of strenuous restrictions that [hashut|E] places upon wider Chaos Dwarf society, on the individual level his faith can be best considered a structure of laws and tenets that every Chaos Dwarf must follow. On account of his "gifts" to their race, in addition to saving them from an ancient, unnamed cataclysm, the entire species is born with a "debt" to [hashut|E] that must be repaid in kind, known as the Great Debt. The god keeps a tally of the good every individual Chaos Dwarf has done for Zharr-Naggrund; it is only near the top of the hierarchy, with total devotion, that any have a chance at repaying their great debt to [hashut|E]. Those who fail are sentenced to eternal slavery in the realm of [hashut|E] so as to pay off the Great Debt, alongside the interest it has accrued. It is this fear of eternal damnation that keeps Chaos Dwarf society competitive, yet tightly ordered - any slip-ups in life would surely mean endless slavery in unlife!"

But make no mistake: There is but one [khorne|E], and all he wants to see is his followers start and win fights in his name, no matter how they do it. Every incarnation of [khorne|E] has several common factors, allowing his worship to be distinguished quickly and easily: hatred for magic, reverence for violence, and demanding of his followers a hostility towards [slaanesh|E], such that the two can easily come to blows."

Originating with the Kurgan tribes of the north, Kjorn rapidly gained near-universal infamy on account of the simplicity of his tenets and the personality of his followers. Kjorn simply wishes for his followers to kill whatever they can get their hands on, including one another if nothing else is available. Every life taken through an act of simple violence will be claimed by the Blood God, their skulls used to build his throne and their blood set aside to slake the immortal thirst of Kjorn. Most who worship the Blood God will find themselves warped beyond recognition, as their identities are seared away one piece at a time by the intensity of their infamous rages - but those that do not succumb to this rage often become some of the greatest strategists of their age. It is said that Kjorn imbues them with such talent to instigate equally great wars in his name, both to defeat the other gods and to provide him with the blood he so dearly covets. The most advanced of their number can expect to become a [daemon_prince|E], understood to be those who Kjorn enjoys watching do battle. Victims must be slain by simple, efficient killing; if killed by magic, rather than martial combat, then they will instead be given to the realm of Tchar. If killed through torture, then they are sent to the realm of Loesh. Allowing a soul to pass on to either of these realms is seen as an unforgivable sin, as it strengthens the eternal enemies of Kjorn."

While the most widespread of all the forms of [malal|E] worship, his popularity is kept low as followers of the other gods will kill his believers on sight. As a result, most have been driven to secrecy; an arrangement that suits their purposes well. Malal gives a promise of simple annihilation: when he is triumphant, the followers of Malal will be the last upon the world, killing one another until there is finally nothing, which will then reign forevermore. He is a distant god, content to watch his followers ruin in his name. This arrangement has made him popular with outcasts, dregs, and those with nothing else to lose, for it is Malal alone that offers the cold reassurance that, when the world is purged of all life, there will finally be no more suffering."

Most gain and maintain their popularity through leveraging a sense of comfort: if every day is the same, and you can make it through one day, then you can survive your entire life as-is. Every separate instance of [nurgle|E] worship characterizes him as a jovial, friendly being, holding a sagely love for life as it currently exists. The notion that one day may be different from the last is blasphemous, and so his followers endeavor to destroy anything that might disrupt the status quo they hold as sacrosanct.

Diseases are known as the "gifts of life", and there is no greater sin against Nieglen than to try to renege on this blessing.

 slaaneshi_kurgan_desc:0 "Known as the Prince of Excess, Loesh is the most widespread incarnation of [slaanesh|E]. Though Loesh is Kurgan in origin, a majority of his worshippers hail from the central Old World. In their mythology, the god Loesh tastes all sensations that his worshippers produce, using the power of emotion to sustain his existence. However, believers in Loesh also believe that these emotions begin to lose their power the more they are invoked. Without new tastes, smells, and agonies, Loesh will eventually wither away to nothing. Being incapable of devising new experiences on his own, the god must rely on their worshippers to do it for them. If a certain sensation were to become "perfected", however, then it would be capable of sustaining Loesh forever - something which all followers pursue, for the satisfaction of both themselves and Loesh. Hedonism and cruelty are not unfortunate side-effects, but moral responsibilities, necessary to continually pursue the ecstasy that sustains both believer and god. Those who come closest to perfection are awarded with [Concept('daemon_prince','immortality')|E], such that they can continue their "research" for all time. Loesh cults also hate anything they perceive to be as too simple, believing it to be anathema to their goddess; as a result, cults of Loesh and cults of Kjorn quickly come to blows with one another."

As a whole, every cult believes in change as the end, not the means; this is a subtle distinction, and one that makes it difficult to differentiate a cult from any other organization should they not advertise themselves."

In the Kurgan mythology, Tchar is the one who gave the gift of magic to the world, such that they would become dependent on his gifts. Through millennia of planning and scheming, Tchar has been able to so thoroughly wrap his hands around all existence that he is effectively omnipotent. Generally, these are represented as strings; each plot a thread that binds fate into a more desirable form. In exchange for favors or offerings, Tchar will occasionally "pluck" the strings around individuals, modifying their fate for good or ill. Most who consort with Tchar will end up tangled in these strings, left to die after their failures catch up with them, but a rare few will outwit any obstacle put in their way by Tchar in order to shake their strings lose and grasp [Concept('daemon_prince','immortality')|E] from the god's hands. These rare few are sacrosanct to all cults of Tchar - if a man is measured by what he is able to accomplish, then those who can outscheme the god of schemers must be incredible indeed. All these cults loathe those who cannot bring about change, and especially those who actively hold it back: believers in Nieglin are to be killed on the spot."

Generally, this involves making sacrifices and offerings to any combination of the four Kurgan gods - Kjorn, Loesh, Nieglin, and Tchar - without abiding by any of their particular lifestyle tenets. The latter part is the most important, and the thing that distinguishes them from a more dedicated worshipper of any god. While they consequently do not face the same restrictions as their cousins, and can expect to avoid the usual religious rivalries, followers of Chaos Undivided generally do not receive nearly as much favor with the gods either. Even so, there is still one prize that awaits any follower of Chaos Undivided: though only one in a generation has the right to claim the reward, any who follows Chaos Undivided might be crowned [everchosen|E], a figure with almost messianic importance in Kurgan mythology."
