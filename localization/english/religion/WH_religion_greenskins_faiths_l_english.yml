    game_concept_waaagh_desc:0 "Named after their distinctive battlecry, a Greenskin Waagh! denotes when, under the control of a particularly powerful (or cunning) warlord manages to gather a substantial amount of greenskins under his command, then sets forth to migrate to other, more interesting lands. While warbands that happen in such a way are not rare, the thing that truly makes one a Waagh! is when a warlord begins to attract other Greenskin warbands to his cause. The scale of a Waagh! makes one hard to miss at later stages, but early ones can still be identified by their restless desire to head \"somewhere else\"."

    greenskin_adj:0 "Gork & Mork"
    greenskin_desc:0 "The Greenskins are a superstitious bunch, and so, they worship a myriad of minor Gods and fetishes, but far above these lesser spirits and trinkets stand Gork and Mork, the true kings of the Greenskin pantheon. They are not worshipped in the weak fashion of the other races, instead all Greenskins look up to the deeds of the twin gods for inspiration. In these tales, Gork is brutally cunning and Mork is cunningly brutal, though the Greenskins tend to fight over which one is what, as they do with everything else. Shamans are in direct (and some times, violent) contact with Gork and Mork, and are even able to summon them in battle in order to crush their enemies or support the other Greenskins"

Due to the havoc the giant spiders caused to the Forest Goblin tribes, they tried to placate the fury of the spiders adding strange eight-legged idols next to the traditional effigies of Gork and Mork. Their shamans started eating an smaller variant of this poisonous spider in order to enter a trance state, which eventually led to communication with the Aracnarock spiders, who were somehow convinced to leave the Goblins alone. Now their nests are sacred places, for the Forest Goblins, home to the great Spider god"

Living as pirates on the open seas, the Freebooters are unique among other Greenskins for their willingness to openly work with other races, but only if they are paid well and if the job includes fighting. Often however the treacherous Greenskins turn against their contractors if they desire more loot or fighting"
