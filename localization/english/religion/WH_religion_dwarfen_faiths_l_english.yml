 dwarfen_religion_desc:0 "The faith of the dwarfs is one of venerating the spirits of their ancestors. These spirits may be the founder of their clan or someone who righted a great grudge, though these are seldom worshipped outside of the clan or hold of their origin. The greatest of these spirits are known as the Ancestor Gods, the primary three of which are venerated in every single Dwarf hold: Grugni — Ancestor God of mining and stoneworking, Valaya — Ancestor Goddess of hearth and home, and Grimnir — Ancestor God of warriors."

#Ancestral Localization
 ancestral:0 "Ancestral"
 ancestral_adj:0 "Ancestral"
 ancestral_desc:0 "Veneration of Ancestors is the centrepiece of Dwarf religion and and important part of their culture. Most of their 'deities' are actually the venerated ancestors of the Dwarf race. The main triad worshipped by most Dwarfs are [grungni|E], [valaya|E] and [grimnir|E]. Many other myriads of ancestors are worshipped by each individual clan and craftguild — usually their founder or someone of great importance to them."

 game_concept_grungni:0 "Grungni"
 game_concept_grungni_desc:0 "The Ancestor God of mining, metalwork and stonework, Grungni is the principal deity of the Dwarf pantheon. He is credited with teaching the Dwarfs all the skills for which they are famous. According to Dwarf lore, Grungni crafted some of the most powerful Dwarf artefacts, including the #italic Throne of Power#!. Foreseeing the coming of Chaos into the world, Grungni led the Dwarfs into the safety of the earth, and when the time was right, he brought forth the Dwarf armies to battle Chaos for the sake of the whole world. He is also the chief husband of [valaya|E]."
 game_concept_grimnir:0 "Grimnir"
 game_concept_grimnir_desc:0 "The brother of [grungni|E] and joint husband of [valaya|E], Grimnir is the patron of warriors, and of Slayers in particular. During their ancient migration, Grimnir protected the Dwarfs from enemies such as Giants, Dragons, and Trolls. The coming of Chaos brought forth new dangers; wielding two mighty axes forged by [grungni|E], Grimnir led the Dwarfs against these abominations. After learning about the polar gate through which the forces of Chaos were entering the world, Grimnir decided to find the ruptured portal and close it with his own hands, even against the advice of [grungni|E] and [valaya|E]. He shaved his head, except for a crest that he dyed orange and spiked with animal fat, and tattooed his body with elaborate patterns that incorporated his personal rune. Dishonoured Dwarfs entering the Slayer cult follow the same ritual today."
 
 game_concept_valaya:0 "Valaya"
 game_concept_valaya_desc:0 "Valaya is the wife of both [grungni|E] and [grimnir|E]. She is the goddess of the hearth, healing, and brewing, the founder of many Dwarfholds (including Karaz-a-Karak and Karak Eight Peaks) and the protector of the Dwarf race. Valaya is credited with establishing the Dwarf culture and inventing their runic script. When [grungni|E] prophesied the coming of Chaos, Valaya devised a special rune to protect the Dwarfs and their underground shelters from the hostile magic inherent in chaos matter."
 
#Norse Ancestral Localization
 norse_ancestral:0 "Norse Ancestral"
 norse_ancestral_adj:0 "Norse Ancestral"
 norse_ancestral_desc:0 "This is an unique form of the Dwarf religion of ancestor worship that evolved independently from the main holds. The Norse variant still worships the ancestors of the Dwarf race but in an animistic fashion with aspects and spirits of the harsh Norscan lands that surround them becoming their "ancestors" as well. [grimnir|E] is held in the highest regard by the Norse Dwarfs and some warriors known as 'Berserkers' similar to the Slayers of their southern cousins try to channel [grimnir|E]'s might in battle by drinking a mix of strong beer and strange mushrooms to enter in a powerful frenzy."
