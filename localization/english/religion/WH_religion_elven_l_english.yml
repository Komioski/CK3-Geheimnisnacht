The cult of Asuryan is the most popular with the Elves of Ulthuan, as he is worshipped by all independently of their profession and class. All Asur must make a pilgrimage to the main temple of Asuryan in the Isle of Flame in Ulthuan at least once. The Isle of Flame is where the Phoenix King is crowned and made to pass the test of the flames of Asuryan. Besides Asuryan, the High Elves also worship the other gods of their pantheon depending on their professions. For example, mages tend to favour Hoeth, the Lord of Wisdom and Knowledge, while smiths worship Vaul, the Maker. The Dark Elves entirely ignore the Cadai pantheon, while the Wood Elves favour Kurnous, the Hunter, over Asuryan."

 loren_cadai_desc:0 "The Wood Elves worship roughly the same Gods as their cousins from Ulthuan, but with some theological differences. The Asrai place more emphasis on the worship of Kurnous, the Hunter, and his wife Isha, the Mother. To the Wood Elves, the whole forest of Athel Loren a temple to Kurnous and Isha, but holy places can be found deep in the forest, special clearings which are recognisable only to those who truly worship them. Small shrines to Asuryan can also be found through Athel Loren, but none close the great temples of Ulthuan. The King and Queen of the Asrai, Orion and Ariel, are respectively the living avatars of Kurnous and Isha."

 cult_of_pleasure_desc:0 "The Cult of Pleasure is an ancient one, stemming from just after the High Elves first won their wars against Chaos. Centred around Morathi, it was destroyed in the wars of the breaking, but from time to time, especially during times of peace and ease, certain Elves of less than stellar character are drawn to recreate it. Its adherents care only for their own pleasures, living indolent lives of splendour and decadence. The Phoenix King is always wary of its return, fearing another bloody civil war, so agents of the crown do all they can to stop it from spreading."

While in Ulthuan and Athel Loren they are only to be appeased in small ceremonies, the Dark Elves of Naggaroth openly worship these deities. The most widely spread religion amongst them is the worship of Khaine, a God of many aspects, but especially, War and Murder. Many small cults and covens worship him, but none are better known than the Witch Elves, which constantly sacrifice prisoners to curry favour with their Bloody God. Other popular gods include, Hekarti, Mistress of Magic, Atharti, Lady of Desire and Anath Raema, the Savage Huntress."

 anath_raema_desc:0 "Anath Raema is an Elven deity who is said to be the sister of Khaine and holds the position of being the goddess of the savage hunt. It is believed that she instilled the joy of the chasing and killing victims to the Dark Elves with the identity of their prey not being of importance. Instead, the blood thirsty goddess enjoys the thrill of the hunt with any living being prey to her. She is said to hold a belt with the hands and heads of the hunters that called upon her aid but never thanked her for her assistance. Anath Raema is said to have made advances to Kurnous only to be spurned by him which is why she is also seen as the patron of jealous lovers who hunts down those that have wronged her followers."

She is represented as a beautiful, masked elf woman, with red serpents tangled around her body. She has a great rivalry with her sister Hekarti, Goddess of Dark Magic, and both have tried to kill each other in multiple occasions. Dark whispers often accuse Atharti followers of being just one misstep away from outright worshipping Slaanesh."
